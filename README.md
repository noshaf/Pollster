Pollster
========

This is an app that I created on my own in class at DevBootcamp July 31st, 2012.
It is a simple poll app where the user may enter a name for a poll, add questions to it, then get the url to send to people to take the poll. At that url people may see the anonymous results that were posted. There is also a heoku app for it here http://pollworld.herokuapp.com/
